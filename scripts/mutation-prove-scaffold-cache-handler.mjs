/**
 * Mutation proof for #896's scaffold cache-handler wiring guard.
 *
 * WHAT #896 CLAIMED, AND WHY IT NEEDS PROVING
 * -------------------------------------------
 * The stability-planning gate found a silent-degradation defect: nothing wired
 * `cacheHandler` in the scaffolded `next.config.ts`, so every `kn-next create`
 * app served 200s with NO ISR cache and NO data cache — full recompute per
 * render, the provisioned Redis unused, and nothing red anywhere. #895/#896's
 * fix is the two template files this prover mutates:
 *   - `templates/app/next.config.ts.hbs` wires `cacheHandler` at a file path and
 *     turns the divergent per-pod in-memory cache OFF (`cacheMaxMemorySize: 0`);
 *   - `templates/app/cache-handler.js.hbs` re-exports the framework handler.
 * `create-scaffold.test.ts` is the guard: it scaffolds a real app from these
 * templates and asserts the wiring survives. #896 shipped with a dated #928
 * exemption instead of a prover, on the (now stale) grounds that concurrent
 * sprint-2 template work owned the subject. That work has landed; this file
 * removes the exemption by proving the guard.
 *
 * THE FOUR MUTATIONS are the ways the #895 defect could quietly return, each an
 * independent RED of the guard, plus a negative control that must stay GREEN.
 *
 * WHY NO `jsStillParses` VALIDATE: the subjects are Handlebars templates
 * (`next.config.ts.hbs` carries a `{{ name }}` expression), so they are not
 * parseable JS at baseline. Every mutation below is a whole-line or whole-value
 * edit that keeps the surrounding syntax intact, and the harness's residue
 * marker lands inline (single-line replacements) so it can never comment out a
 * statement tail — the failure mode `jsStillParses` guards against does not
 * arise here. `.hbs` has no COMMENT_PREFIX entry, so each mutation passes an
 * explicit `commentPrefix: '//'` (valid for both the TS- and JS-flavoured
 * templates); this is the file-specific case #942 F5 sanctions.
 *
 * DISCIPLINE (`.claude/rules/workflow.md`): exit codes only; green baseline; a
 * canary red first; anchors exactly once or abort; clean tree between mutations.
