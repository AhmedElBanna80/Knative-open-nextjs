/**
 * Mutation proof for #899's Bun-free CLI static-closure guard.
 *
 * WHAT #899 CLAIMED, AND WHY IT NEEDS PROVING
 * -------------------------------------------
 * The published `kn-next` bin must run under plain Node — `npx kn-next` cannot
 * assume Bun on PATH. `cli-node-runtime.test.ts` pins that: it walks the static
 * closure of `src/cli/*.ts` plus every relative import reachable from it and
 * asserts the closure imports no `bun`/`bun:*` module, touches no `Bun.` global,
 * and carries the `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang on every executable entry.
 *
 * The exemption this file removes claimed the guard's SURVIVING assertions are
 * NEGATIVE (deleted seam files must stay deleted) and therefore low-value to
 * prove. That reads only half the spec. The three assertions above are POSITIVE
 * source-closure scans — they FIRE when a Bun-ism is reintroduced, which is the
 * regression that would break `npx kn-next` under Node — and those are exactly
 * what this prover exercises: it INJECTS each Bun-ism into a closure source file
 * (`src/cli/deploy.ts`, the published bin's entry) and shows the guard reddens.
 * The `dist/`-gated built-bin assertions in the same spec stay covered by
 * install-smoke; this prover deliberately targets the source scans, not those.
 *
 * THE THREE MUTATIONS reintroduce each forbidden Bun surface; the negative
 * control adds the word "bun" in the ONE shape the guard sanctions (a string
 * literal — `runtime: "bun"` config, spawning the external `bun` binary), which
 * must stay GREEN.
 *
 * DISCIPLINE (`.claude/rules/workflow.md`): exit codes only; green baseline; a
 * canary red first; anchors exactly once or abort; clean tree between mutations.
